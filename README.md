Readme goes here, with all sorts of fun examples and such.

- Write tests around the "check we are tracking callbacks that are called 0 or 2+ times" bits
- Write it up in the readme.
- Investigate that __apply thing. "this" there will be "module", so maybe it will share state it shouldn't. Is there a better thing to use there, null or undefined maybe?
- Fill in the package.json a bit better
